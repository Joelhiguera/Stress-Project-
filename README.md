# This is a Stress Questionnaire for the first group project of the UofU Coding Bootcamp.

## The goal of this assignment was to create a unique webpage from scratch that called at least 2 server-side APIs, while coordinating with the group. This was completed using HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, Tailwind CSS, the Google Maps API, and the Youtube API.
